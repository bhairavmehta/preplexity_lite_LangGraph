# Application Development with Preplexity_lite LangGraph, Tavily AI, and GPT-3

In this project, I have utilized LangGraph, a library designed for building stateful, multi-actor applications. LangGraph, built on LangChain, allows for the coordination of multiple 'actors' in a cyclical computation process. This is particularly useful for adding cycles to your LLM applications, extending beyond the capabilities of a traditional DAG framework.
I also used Tavily AI, an incredible tool for rapid insights and comprehensive research. Tavily AI streamlines the research process, from source gathering to organizing results, making it an invaluable asset for developers.
Of course, the project wouldn't be complete without discussing GPT-3, a large language model that's pivotal in the development of advanced AI applications.
By combining these tools, I've managed to create an application similar to Perplexity AI, known for its ability to unlock knowledge through information discovery and sharing.

## Project Overview

This project represents a significant leap forward in the realm of AI-driven applications, thanks to the integration of cutting-edge technologies and platforms. By harnessing the power of Preplexitylite LangGraph, Tavily AI, and GPT-3, I've developed an application that not only enhances the capabilities of language model-based applications but also streamlines the research and insight generation process.

## Core Technologies Employed

### LangGraph: Dynamic Multi-Actor System Orchestration

- **Foundation**: Built on the robust LangChain framework, LangGraph is engineered to support the development of stateful, multi-actor systems.
- **Functionality**: It excels in orchestrating multiple 'actors' within a cyclic computational framework, breaking away from the limitations of traditional DAG architectures.
- **Advantages**: This approach significantly broadens the scope of LLM-based applications, introducing the ability to integrate cyclic processes for more complex and dynamic interactions.

### Tavily AI: Streamlining Research and Insight Generation

- **Efficiency**: Tavily AI stands out for its ability to rapidly generate insights and facilitate comprehensive research efforts.
- **Workflow Optimization**: The platform enhances the entire research process, from data collection to the organized presentation of results, making it an invaluable tool for developers and researchers alike.

### GPT-3: The Backbone of AI Solutions

- **Role**: OpenAI's GPT-3 serves as a cornerstone of this project, providing the advanced language understanding and generation capabilities necessary for innovative AI solutions.
- **Impact**: The integration of GPT-3 allows for the development of applications that can mimic human-like understanding and response generation, setting new standards in AI technology.

## Application Capabilities

The collaboration of these technologies has led to the creation of an application that mirrors the functionality of platforms like Perplexity AI. Known for its ability to unlock knowledge through intuitive information discovery and sharing, our application aims to facilitate a similar level of interaction and knowledge exchange.

## Key Features in the Codebase

A notable feature within the project's codebase is the `Create_openai_functions_agent` function found in LangChain's agents module. This function is pivotal in setting up an agent capable of utilizing OpenAI's APIs for advanced tasks:

- **Parameters**: It takes a `BaseLanguageModel` instance to define the language model, a sequence of `BaseTool` instances as the tools, and a `ChatPromptTemplate` for the agent's prompt configuration.
- **Outcome**: The function returns a `Runnable` instance, which is primed for execution, showcasing the practical application of integrating multiple AI technologies to create a versatile and dynamic agent.

## Conclusion

The synergy of LangGraph, Tavily AI, and GPT-3 in this project not only underscores the potential of combining multiple AI technologies but also highlights the innovative approaches to application development. This project sets a precedent for future endeavors in creating sophisticated AI-driven applications that can navigate and process complex data structures and workflows.
