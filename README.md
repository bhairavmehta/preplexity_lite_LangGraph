In the development of this project, I have employed LangGraph, a sophisticated library engineered for the construction of dynamic, multi-actor systems. Originating from LangChain, LangGraph facilitates the orchestration of several 'actors' within a cyclic computational framework, an attribute that significantly enhances the functionality of LLM-based applications by integrating cyclic processes, a feature not typically supported by conventional Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architectures.

Furthermore, the project leveraged Tavily AI, an exceptional platform renowned for its efficiency in generating rapid insights and conducting thorough research. Tavily AI optimizes the entire research workflow, from the initial collection of sources to the structured presentation of findings, proving to be an indispensable resource for development efforts.

An integral component of this endeavor is GPT-3, OpenAI's expansive language model, which plays a critical role in the formulation of cutting-edge AI solutions.

The synergy of these technologies has culminated in the creation of an application that echoes the functionalities of Perplexity AI, celebrated for its adeptness in facilitating the exploration and exchange of knowledge.

Within the project's codebase, the Create_openai_functions_agent function within LangChain's agents module stands out. This function is instrumental in configuring an agent that leverages OpenAI's APIs for tasks requiring functional API capabilities. It requires three parameters: a BaseLanguageModel instance to specify the language model, a sequence of BaseTool instances for the tools, and a ChatPromptTemplate for the agent's prompt setup. The outcome is a Runnable instance, ready for deployment in the agent's execution.
